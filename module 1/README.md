# Module 1 — Introduction to Microsoft 365 and SharePoint Online (Admin View)

**Course:** Modern SharePoint Online for Administrators (3-Day, 2026 aligned)  
**Module duration (suggested):** 2.0–2.5 hours instruction + 30–45 min lab  
**Level:** Intermediate

## Scenario (used across all labs)
This course uses a shared-tenant scenario designed for **1 trainer + 10 administrator participants**:

- Scenario: **Project Northwind Intranet Modernization**
- Scenario overview: ../scenario/Lab-Scenario-Overview.md
- Participant naming convention: **P01–P10** with prefixes like `NW-P03-...`

## Learning objectives
By the end of this module, learners will be able to:
1. Describe where SharePoint Online fits in Microsoft 365.
2. Explain high-level service architecture concepts (identity, workloads, admin surfaces).
3. Contrast SharePoint Online and SharePoint Server at a conceptual level.
4. Navigate Microsoft 365 admin center and SharePoint admin center for common tenant checks.
5. Identify “limits, quotas, and boundaries” and where to verify current values in Microsoft Learn.

## Audience prerequisites
- Microsoft 365 tenant access (demo or production)
- Role: at least **SharePoint Administrator** (recommended) or Global Administrator
- Basic familiarity with Microsoft 365 admin concepts (users, groups, licenses)

## Deliverables in this folder
- Student guide chapter: Module-01-Student-Guide.md
- Lab guide: Lab-01-Exploring-the-Microsoft-365-Environment.md
- Slides outline: Module-01-Slides.md

## Instructor notes (quick)
- Avoid quoting exact numeric limits in class; teach learners how to find the current “limits and boundaries” page and interpret it.
- Expect UI variation between tenants; teach “how to find” vs “click exactly here”.
- If learners can’t access admin centers, validate roles early (Module 2 goes deeper, but this module needs basic access).

## Shared-tenant lab safety (important)
- In Module 1, keep activities **verification-first** and avoid tenant-wide changes.
- If a later module requires a tenant-wide change, treat it as **Trainer-only** unless the lab explicitly isolates changes to each participant’s practice site.

## Validation checkpoint (end of module)
Learners can:
- Open Microsoft 365 admin center, locate Service health and Message center.
- Open SharePoint admin center and find tenant-level settings areas.
- Explain 3 differences between SharePoint Online and SharePoint Server without focusing on feature checklists.
