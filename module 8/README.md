# Module 8 — Content Governance and Compliance with Microsoft Purview

**Course:** Modern SharePoint Online for Administrators (3-Day, 2026 aligned)  \
**Module duration (suggested):** 1.5–2.0 hours instruction + 75–105 min lab  \
**Level:** Intermediate

## Scenario continuity (shared tenant)
This module continues the course scenario:
- Scenario overview: ../scenario/Lab-Scenario-Overview.md

Shared-tenant note (trainer + 10 admin participants):
- Compliance configuration (labels, eDiscovery, DLP) is often **tenant-impacting**. In this course delivery:
  - **Trainer-led** for creating/publishing policies and any tenant-wide settings.
  - **Participants** focus on applying labels to content inside their own `NW-Pxx-ProjectSite`.

## Learning objectives
By the end of this module, learners will be able to:
1. Explain the purpose of Microsoft Purview for compliance and data governance.
2. Describe the difference between **retention labels** and **retention policies** (and how retention label policies publish labels).
3. Explain **sensitivity labels**, label publishing policies, and why replication time matters.
4. Describe the modern eDiscovery workflow and the role of cases, holds, and searches.
5. Describe DLP as a control, and why simulation/pilot scoping is the safe rollout approach.

## Validation checkpoint (end of module)
Learners can:
- Apply a published retention label and sensitivity label to documents in SharePoint.
- Explain why label/policy changes may take time to appear.
- Explain (at a high level) how eDiscovery cases, holds, and searches work.
- Explain why DLP should be deployed using simulation and scoped pilots first.
