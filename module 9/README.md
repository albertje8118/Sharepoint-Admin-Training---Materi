1. Explain how OneDrive for Business relates to SharePoint Online (personal sites) and why this matters for administration.
2. Identify where OneDrive settings are configured (SharePoint admin center) and which settings are tenant-wide.
3. Describe sharing controls and safe internal-sharing practices in a shared tenant.
4. Describe sync controls and the difference between **OneDrive shortcuts** and **Sync**.
5. Explain storage and lifecycle controls for OneDrive, including retention for deleted users and restore concepts.
6. Explain device access controls for unmanaged devices and the operational impacts (replication time, modern auth dependencies).
