# Module 11 — Operations at Scale: Monitoring, Lifecycle, and External Sharing Governance

**Course:** Modern SharePoint Online for Administrators (3-Day, 2026 aligned)  \
**Module duration (suggested):** 1.5–2.0 hours instruction + 75–105 min lab  \
**Level:** Intermediate

## Scenario continuity (shared tenant)
- Scenario overview: ../scenario/Lab-Scenario-Overview.md

Module 11 extends the Northwind story into operational readiness:
- incident triage habits (Service health, Message center, common SharePoint/OneDrive errors)
- site lifecycle governance (provisioning, restore expectations)
- external sharing governance (link types, defaults, restrictions)

Shared-tenant note:
- Participants perform **read-only verification + reporting**.
- Any tenant-wide governance changes are **trainer-led**.

## Learning objectives
By the end of this module, learners will be able to:
1. Use Microsoft 365 Service health and Message center during incidents.
2. Triage common SharePoint/OneDrive access issues using built-in checks (e.g., Check Permissions) and diagnostics.
3. Explain the deleted site restore model and why root-site mistakes are high impact.
4. Describe external sharing link types and governance levers (org-level vs site-level, defaults).
5. Produce basic operational reports (site inventory, user membership) and document change requests safely.
