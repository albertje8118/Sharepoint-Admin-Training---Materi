# Module 2 — Identity, Access, and External Sharing

**Course:** Modern SharePoint Online for Administrators (3-Day, 2026 aligned)  
**Module duration (suggested):** 2.0–2.5 hours instruction + 45–60 min lab  
**Level:** Intermediate

## Scenario continuity (shared tenant)
This module continues the course scenario:
- Scenario overview: ../scenario/Lab-Scenario-Overview.md

Shared-tenant note (trainer + 10 admin participants):
- Treat tenant-wide policy changes as **Trainer-only** unless explicitly isolated.
- Participant hands-on work should happen inside participant practice sites using `NW-Pxx-...` naming.

> Practice sites are created by participants during the course flow using `NW-Pxx-ProjectSite`.

## Learning objectives
By the end of this module, learners will be able to:
1. Explain the relationship between Microsoft Entra ID identity, admin roles, and SharePoint permissions.
2. Distinguish tenant admin roles vs site-level permissions and ownership.
3. Describe guest access and B2B collaboration concepts and common admin controls.
4. Configure (or validate) external sharing at the organization and site level using SharePoint admin center.
5. Explain Conditional Access at a high level and why it matters for SharePoint access.
